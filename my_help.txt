1. Downlaod And Install elastiserach engine:
    https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch

2. unzip and install the elastic search 
    open command prompt: navigate to the folder where you have extract the file
    then install it (command): .\bin\elasticsearch 
        E:\semantic_search_engine\elasticsearch-8.15.2>.\bin\elasticsearch 

    check the installation :
        go to browser : https://localhost:9200/
        for first time installation (user id and password is given at installation in command promt)
            user : elastic
            password :  iiGa0a1_zTfj8ijJPksW

        (if a web window with some JSON apperr - installation completed successfully)

3. Get the data create venev(if needed) - install elasticsearch, pandas, sentence_transformers

4. indexData.ipynb
        connect to elastic search
        load the data 
            do all the necessary EDA (done in another notebook)
        convert relevant search filed reuired to vector using BERT model - pretrained
            getting the embeddings vector
            model : https://sbert.net/docs/sentence_transformer/pretrained_models.html


5. indexMapping.py - making the mapping - JSON schema of the data_id present in out data_frame

6. indexData.ipynb
    CREATE new index in elastic search
    converting data_frame data to JSON (key value pair)- for elastic search ingest
    ingest the data/record into created index in elastic search

    SEARCH THE DATA:
        create the embedding of the "input _keyword" using BERT model
        create a  QUERY of inputted keyword 
        perfrom the elastic search - retive the results with matching embedding - semantic_search_engine

7. Deploy to streanlit - searchApp.py
    install streamlit in created_venv (elastic_venv)
    extra : specify the threshold similarity score - under with result should not be displayed as they are far in semantics from inputted keyword

# Semantic Search Engine

A semantic search engine is a type of search engine that understands the meaning behind the words used in a query, rather than just matching keywords. Unlike traditional search engines that rely on exact word matches, semantic search looks at the context and relationships between words to provide more accurate results. It helps to find more relevant information even if the search query doesn't exactly match the text in the documents.

This project, aims to built a semantic search engine using BERT  and Elasticsearch (a search engine for indexing and querying data). This system can better understand the intent behind a query, improving the search experience by providing more meaningful results.
